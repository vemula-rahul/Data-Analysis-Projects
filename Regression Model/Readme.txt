The file contains "big data" from 64,000 customers of an online retailer who purchased from that retail website within the last twelve months. 

Problem Statment.
These customers are randomly chosen by the retailer for an e-mail campaign: a third of these customers received an e-mail campaign featuring Men’s merchandise, one-third received an e-mail campaign featuring Women’s merchandise, and the remaining third received no e-mail (control group). Customer’s purchase behaviors (whether they visited the retailer website, whether they made a purchase, and and  how much money they spend) were tracked for two weeks following the e-mail campaign. Analyze and inform the retailer if the Men’s or Women’s e-mail campaign was successful, and under what circumstances.

Research Questions to answer the problem statement:

1.How did the promotion campaigns work relative to the control group? Did the men's promotions work better than the women's promotion (or vice versa) and by how much?
2.Should we target these promotions to new customers (who joined over the last 12 months) rather than to established customers, or vice versa?
3. Should we target these promotions to customers who have a higher (or lower) history of spending over the last year?
4. Did the promotions work better for phone or web channel?
5.Will the promotions work better if the men's promotion is targeted at customers who bought men's merchandise over the last year (compared to those who purchased women's merchandise), and if the women's promotion would work better if targeted at customers who bought women's merchandise over the last year?
